Recent advances in computing hardware, such as the V100 to H200 series, have temporarily alleviated this issue, reducing the immediate need for alternatives in the industry. Linear-complexity solutions for large models are still in the research phase, lacking widespread validation in practical applications. Consequently, Transformer remains the preferred choice.\r\n\r\nHowever, as improvements in computing power slow down, the demand for architectures that surpass Transformer in efficiency will grow. Our team has developed Lightning Attention, a novel mechanism based on linear attention. By rearranging the QKV multiplication order (Q(KV)), Lightning Attention achieves linear computational complexity relative to sequence length. Experiments show it significantly outperforms the latest Transformers in both efficiency and performance, validated on a 456B MoE model (MiniMax 01). This innovation paves the way for more efficient large language models, offering new possibilities for future development.",

However, recent research has shown that their deeper layers often contribute minimally, with effectiveness diminishing as layer depth increases. This pattern presents significant opportunities for model compression. In the first part of this seminar, we will explore how this phenomenon can be harnessed to improve the efficiency of LLM compression. Despite these opportunities, the underutilization of deeper layers leads to inefficiencies, wasting resources that could be better used to enhance model performance. The second part of the talk will address the root cause of this ineffectiveness in deeper layers and propose a solution. We identify the issue as stemming from the prevalent use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) and introduce LayerNorm Scaling to solve this issue. ",

        "content": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community for their power and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across various applications. Although LLMs offer unprecedented opportunities for research and innovation, its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open LLM models lack the necessary components (such as training code and data) for full understanding and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be “open-source”, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we follow the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We present a truly open source LLM Moxin 7B and release pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning data, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. We also finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization, an efficient and effective reinforcement learning algorithm following DeepSeek R1, to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model.",

Efficient and scalable data collection has thus emerged as a key research focus in robotics.\r\nA widely used method is teleoperation, where humans either wear VR devices or operate a secondary robot to guide actions. While effective, these approaches are limited by hardware-specific constraints and require complex setups, hindering scalability.\r\nAn emerging alternative is to learn directly from human demonstrations without relying on teleoperation hardware. This paradigm allows robots to acquire task-relevant motion data by observing or interpreting natural human movements, offering a more flexible and hardware-agnostic solution.\r\nIn this talk, I will introduce a novel framework for robot data acquisition from human demonstrations. I will detail how it bypasses traditional teleoperation limitations and enables scalable learning across varied tasks and environments.

Supported by hundreds of contributors and productized through Red Hat AI, vLLM provides a vendor-neutral solution for serving cutting-edge models at scale. This talk outlines a practical blueprint for scaling LLM inference using vLLM, integrating both system-level techniques and model-level optimizations.\n\n We begin by addressing the challenges of deploying LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning in production. Leveraging vLLM’s engine architecture, multi-accelerator deployments using tensor parallelism, paged attention scheduling, and prefill–decode disaggregation demonstrate how a single node can efficiently drive multiple AI accelerators, enhancing throughput without compromising latency.\n\n The second optimization layer focuses on quantization. Based on over 500,000 evaluations across language and vision-language models, we examine the accuracy–speed trade-offs of weight and activation quantization. We introduce new pathways that significantly reduce memory usage while maintaining model quality. Attendees will leave with data-driven insights and ready-to-use configurations for deploying state-of-the-art quantized models in scalable enterprise inference pipelines.",

What begins as a single-GPU prototype must eventually scale across thousands of devices, each step introducing new complexity.\n\n This talk dives into the practicalities of ultra-scale training. We'll explore how 5D parallelism—spanning data, tensor, pipeline, context, and expert dimensions—makes it possible to stretch a single training run across massive GPU clusters. Along the way, we’ll cover performance tuning, communication patterns, and architecture choices that impact throughput and hardware efficiency.\n\n A key reference for this session is the Ultra-Scale Playbook, which distills best practices and hard-earned lessons from real-world LLM scaling efforts. We’ll walk through highlights of the playbook, tying them into case studies, benchmarks, and hands-on recommendations.\n\n Scaling isn’t just about size—it’s about doing more with what you have. This webinar offers a comprehensive look at what it really takes to train state-of-the-art models at scale, designed for engineers, researchers, and practitioners ready to move beyond “it fits on one GPU” toward infrastructure that powers trillion-parameter models—efficiently, and at speed.",

It began as an implementation of BERT, continued to a \"\"one model, one file\"\" setup—ideal for iteration—and grew into a modular codebase now defining 315+ models. Transformers has become a reference implementation for the field: a source of truth for model architectures, behaviors, and pretraining conventions. Its evolution reflects PyTorch’s own: grounded in Pythonic values, but pragmatic enough to diverge when needed.\n\n PyTorch’s ecosystem has replaced entire toolchains. Scaling models has become simpler: torch.compile brings compiler-level speedups with minimal code changes, and new abstractions like DTensor offer serious performance gains without the low-level complexity.\n\n Both PyTorch and Transformers inherit Python’s spirit—clarity, flexibility, expressiveness—without being bound by it. PyTorch leans on ATen and C++ kernels under the hood; Transformers increasingly rely on optimized community kernels and hardware-aware implementations from the hub.\n\n Modularity and readability didn’t just improve maintainability—they grew the community. Lowering the barrier to entry encourages experimentation, contributions, and faster innovation. This talk tracks that journey—from how PyTorch enabled Transformers, to how the virtuous cycle of design, performance, and pragmatism continues to shape the tools driving modern AI.",
