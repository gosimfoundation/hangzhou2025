      <h1>China Essentials</h1>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>Before You Go</h2>
      <br />
      It is recommended to either install an eSIM application on your phone before
      arriving, or upon arriving at the airport, to purchase a local China SIM card,
      in order to stay connected during your stay in China. (Note that in USA newer
      iPhones such as iPhone 14, etc. will not have a physical SIM card and can only
      take eSIMs)
      <br /><br />

      <h3>Internet (eSIM)</h3>
      <br />
      It is recommened to get an eSIM in order to use your mobile's data services
      for internet in China. The best deals are probably purchased ahead of time
      online. But it can also be done after arriving.
      <br /><br />
      Of course, you can also enable international roaming from your current mobile
      plan provider. For example, T-mobile customer can purchase 1 time, 30 day,
      15GB plan for $50+taxes. You can also use your personal hotspot to connect
      your laptop.
      <br /><br />
      We've personally used <a href="https://www.airalo.com/china-esim"
        ><strong>Airalo</strong></a
      > with success but there are other similar and potentially cheaper options
      available. Another popular one is called <a
        href="https://esim.holafly.com/esim-china/"><strong>Holafly</strong></a
      >. Others have used <a href="https://www.getnomad.app/china-eSIM"
        ><strong>Nomad</strong></a
      > succesfully as well. A newer one that lots of folks like: <a
        href="https://saily.com/esim-china/"><strong>Sally</strong></a
      >
      <br /><br />
      Depending on if you're going to be in China only or other nearby countries,
      you can buy the eSIM for specifically one country, or a regional eSIM which
      works in multiple countries. (Regional will cost slightly more)
      <br /><br />

      <h3>eSIM Apps</h3>
      <br />
      For internet access on mobile phone if you do not want to use roaming feature
      of your home mobile carrier. (You may also need a VPN app in addition to the
      eSIM app)
      <ul>
        <li>➤ <a href="https://www.airalo.com/china-esim">Airalo</a></li>
        <li>➤ <a href="https://esim.holafly.com/esim-china/">Holafly</a></li>
        <li>➤ <a href="https://www.getnomad.app/china-eSIM">Nomad</a></li>
        <li>➤ <a href="https://saily.com/esim-china/">Sally</a></li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />


      <h3>VPN</h3>
      <br />
      A lot of the websites/apps, such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp etc.,
      cannot be accessed using regular internet in China. One can install VPN client(s)
      ahead of time.
      <br /><br />
      Many "mainstream" VPN services will not work, such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN.
      <br /><br />
      Here are a list of VPN services that "should" work:
      <ul>
        <li>
          ➤ <strong>Let's VPN</strong> - worked as of July. This can be a backup.
          It has a free trial period so you can make sure it works. After that, paid
          service 1 week price is only $2.99. Client available on iOS, MacOS, Android
          & Windows. (But 2 devices max)
        </li>
        <li>
          ➤ If you use International Roaming (i.e. Using a foreign SIM card with
          roaming service turned on), you do not need to use a VPN.
        </li>
        <li>
          ➤ Also you may not need VPN if you're using Google-Fi mobile service
          (not validated personally)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />

      <h3>Apps To Download</h3>
      <br />
      It's recommended to download the following apps ahead of time as they're very
      useful getting around in China.
      <ul>
        <li>
          ➤ WeChat <strong>[Highly Recommended]</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>➤ Instant and group messaging + Payment + social, etc.</li>
            <li>
              ➤ Some Museum need Wechat Payment for booking and paying for
              ticket
            </li>
            <li>
              ➤ Likely will require verification by an existing WeChat/WeiXin
              user/friend
            </li>
            <li>
              ➤ Please search for ‘WeChat’ in the App Store or on the official
              WeChat website https://weixin.qq.com/, after logging in, please go
              to ‘Me - Services - Wallet - Cards’ and bind an international
              credit card, which will allow you to make payments in China. As
              for now, there are no transaction fees for purchases less then or
              equal to $200; a 3% transaction fee will be charged for anything
              above this amount. （It is recommended to bind to a credit card
              which does not charge Foreign Transaction Fees, although the 3%
              may not be avoidable)
            </li>
            <li>
              ➤ WeChat binding and payment guide:
              <ul>

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          •AliPay <strong>[Must Have]</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ➤ Alternative Payment method to WeChat (99% of busines supports
              WeChat Payment and/or AliPay)
            </li>
            <li>➤ It is easier to setup than WeChat payment</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />

      <h3>Transportation Apps</h3>
      <br />
      To get around in the city, you may use either public transport, or use an Uber-like
      service. The main app for that is Didi.
      <ul>
        <li>
          ➤ Didi <strong>[Highly Recommended]</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ➤ "Uber of China". Useful for calling cars to get around the city
            </li>
            <li>
              ➤ Uber does not work in China market, so Didi is the main choice
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />

      <h3>Navigation Apps</h3>
      <br />
      Although Google Maps works if you're using VPN, the map may not be as accurate,
      and there may not be as much local data.
      <br />
      Alternative, Apple Maps works well in China. But the best ones are Gaode and
      Baidu Maps for local map and navigation.
      <ul>
        <li>➤ Gaode Maps 高德地图</li>
        <li>➤ Baidu Maps 百度地图</li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />

      <h3>Payment</h3>
      <br />
      China is mostly a cashless country now, most people use Alipay and/or WeChat
      Pay to bind your foreign credit card with the payment apps.
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          ➤ <a
            href="https://wise.com/us/blog/alipay-for-foreigners#:~:text=You'd%20normally%20need%20a,in%20CNY%20while%20in%20China."
            >https://wise.com/us/blog/alipay-for-foreigners#:~:text=You'd%20normally%20need%20a,in%20CNY%20while%20in%20China.</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          ➤ <a
            href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wechat-enables-foreigners-to-pay-with-overseas-cards-in-china/"
            >https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wechat-enables-foreigners-to-pay-with-overseas-cards-in-china/</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />

      <h3>Currency</h3>
      <br />
      If you have WeChat and/or Alipay setup ahead of time (registered and added
      your own credit cards), most of the time, there's no need to carry or use cash
      (RMB) in China.
      <br /><br />
